# Pizza dough

This is a big batch, it's sized for approximately 7 large pizzas at 400g each.
Scale the recipe to fit. 

A more normal size pizza pie is in the 200-250g weight range.

## Ingredients

* 1300g   high protein weat flour
* 200g    whole weat flour
* 45g     excellent quality salt
* 225g    sourdough starter
* 75g     excellent quality olive oil
* 7.5g    fresh yeast
* 1000g   room temperatur water

## Preparing the dough

* Mix dry ingredients in a large bowl
* Mix wet ingredients in a separate bowl
* Combine the dry and wet ingredients until fully combined.
* Autolyse for 1h.
* Stretch and fold the dough 5 times with 15 minute between each fold
* Let the dough bulk ferment in the fridge for about 8h
* Shape the pizza buns and put them on an oiled tray, also apply some oil on top of the buns, cover in plastic.
* Place in fridge and let rest until it's time to bake the pies.

## Making the pizzas

* Turn the oven to the max temperature at least 1 hour before baking. Use a baking stone or sheet.
* When the oven is hot enough you can shape the pizza pies.
  * I work from the middle and press the dough outwards, leaving large edges.
  * Stretch the dough using the pizza man technique.
* Place the ready dough on a lightly floured pizza spatula.
* Apply sauces and cheese and bake the pizza for approximately 8 minutes, depending on the oven. My oven goes to 250 degrees, so 8 minutes works nicely.
* Remove the pizza using the spatula and apply the toppings that go after, typically this is when I apply meat products.

## Favorite pizza toppings

* Tomato sauce, mozarella and prosciutto
* Creme fraiche, lightly boiled (and drained), thin slices of potato with Svedjan hard cheese (in case you can't find Svedjan, use VÃ¤sterbottenost), sprinkle rose mary on top. The potatoes might need some salt also.
