# Pizza dough

This is a big batch, it's sized for approximately 7 large pizzas at 400g each.
Scale the recipe to fit. A more normal size pizza pie is in the 200-250g weight
range.

## Ingredients

1300g   high protein weat flour
200g    whole weat flour
45g     excellent quality salt
225g    sourdough starter
75g     excellent quality olive oil
7.5g    fresh yeast
1000g   room temperatur water

## Preparing the dough

Mix dry ingredients in a large bowl
Mix wet ingredients in a separate bowl
Combine the dry and wet ingredients until fully combined.
Autolyse for 1h.
Stretch and fold the dough for 5 times with 15 minute between each fold
Let the dough bulk ferment in the fridge for about 8h
Shape the pizza buns and put them on an oiled tray, also apply some oil on top
of the buns. Place in the fridge and let rest until it's time to bake the
pies.

## Making the pizzas

Turn the oven to the max temperature at least 1 hour before baking. Use a
baking stone or sheet.
When the owen is hot enough you can shape the pizza pies.
I work from the middle and press the dough outwards, leaving large edges.
Stretch the dough using the pizza man technique.
Place the ready dough on a lightly floured spatula.
Apply sauces and cheese and bake the pizza for approximately 8 minutes,
depending on the oven. My owen goes to 250 degrees, so 8 minutes works nicely.
Remove the pizza using the spatula and apply the toppings that go after,
typically this is when I apply meat products.
